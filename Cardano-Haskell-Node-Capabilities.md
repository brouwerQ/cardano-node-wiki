‚ö†Ô∏è **Iteration #1 Limitations** ‚ö†Ô∏è  

There are a few limitations to keep in mind due to the fact that certain things have not yet been integrated.

**Storage** The real storage system has not yet been integrated. The node now is using the mock storage implementation. The consequence of this is that the chain storage is in-memory and not on disk. So this limits the size of the chain that can be tested, and the chain is not persistent on restart. So this precludes syncing with mainnet. The full storage subsystem uses the same API as the mock one so the integration is expected to be straightforward, and it is expected to be integrated for the next demo.

**Connection management** The network connection management subsystem has not yet been integrated. The node is currently using very simplistic static connection logic: it will establish the requested connections on startup but not re-establish connections on failure. The consequence is that any peer disconnecting causes an exception that will shut down the node. The full connection management subsystem is currently in testing and it is expected to be integrated for the next demo.

**Mainnet validation** We have previously demonstrated mainnet validation for the ledger rules, but have not yet demonstrated that for the PBFT consensus rules. While the PBFT rules are integrated, there are some remaining parts to complete to be able to validate mainnet. In particular the support for EBBs (epoch boundary blocks). Therefore it is not currently possible with the node at this stage to sync with mainnet. We anticipate that this will be completed in time for the next demo.

**Local clients** The node to client protocol has been integrated but the chain sync part does not yet have a example client. This will be needed for wallet integration. This is a relatively small addition and so we expect to have a chain sync client template available for the next demo.

**Transaction relay** The node to node transaction submission protocol has not yet been integrated. This means that while it is possible to submit transactions locally to a block producing node, it is not yet possible to submit them to one node and have them forwarded to other nodes. The code for this component is mostly complete, including tests, so we anticipate that this will be integrated in time for the next demo.
